To add a new branch titled my-new-feature: git branch my-new-feature
Remember that the check which branch you're on or you've created: git branch
To make my-new-feature the current branch: git checkout my-new-feature
Looking at git status will also tell you which branch your on (Pro tip)
Delete a branch using -d flag with git branch: git branch -d my-new-feature
To combine changes made on different branches, use merge.
Git incorporates other branches into the currenc branch by default.
So first go to your base branch, then merge: git merge update-readme
OK, but what if there are two commits in two seperate branches that make different edits to the same line of text?
That's what we call 'a conflict'
In this case, merging the two branching will require you to nano the merged file to change/remove the 
unwanted text.

To summarize:
a) Git branching allows you and others to work on the same code base together.
b) You can create a branche with the command git branch [name of branch]
c) To switch to a branch use git checkout [name of branch]
d) You can combine a branch with your current branch by using git merge.
